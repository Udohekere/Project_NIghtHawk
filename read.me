    <h1>Project Nighthawk: Advanced Defense Evasion via Custom Direct Syscall Reflection</h1>

    <h2>üö® Project Overview and Threat Model</h2>
    <p>Project Nighthawk is a technical Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating a highly stealthy payload execution and Command and Control (C2) implant loader, written in C#/.NET.</p>
    <p>The tool is engineered specifically for advanced Defense Evasion (T1574) and designed to defeat sophisticated Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions.</p>
    <p>The threat model targets EDR products that rely on two main detection strategies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User-land API hooking:</strong> Where EDR monitors security-sensitive Win32 functions (e.g., <code>VirtualAllocEx</code>).</li>
        <li><strong>Static file analysis:</strong> Which requires the malicious payload to exist on disk.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Nighthawk counters these defenses through two integrated techniques: Dynamic Direct System Calls (Syscalls) for kernel interaction and Custom Reflective DLL Loading for in-memory execution.</p>

    <h2>‚öôÔ∏è Evasion Technique 1: Direct Syscalls Implementation</h2>

    <h3>Rationale for Hook Bypass</h3>
    <p>Standard malware executes sensitive operations by calling high-level Win32 APIs (e.g., functions within <code>kernel32.dll</code>). These functions typically contain user-land hooks inserted by EDR agents to inspect or block suspicious activity before execution.</p>
    <p>Direct Syscalls bypass these defensive hooks by directly calling the Native NTDLL API functions (e.g., <code>ZwAllocateVirtualMemory</code>) and immediately executing the specialized <code>syscall</code> instruction to transition directly into kernel mode, thus circumventing the monitored user-land space entirely.</p>

    <h3>Dynamic Syscall Number Resolution</h3>
    <p>A significant challenge in implementing Direct Syscalls is that the Syscall numbers (the identifiers used by the kernel) are volatile and can change across Windows versions or patch levels. Hardcoding these numbers often leads to instability or detection by security software monitoring this variance.</p>
    <p>Project Nighthawk implements dynamic resolution to ensure portability and stealth. The loader inspects the exported functions of <code>ntdll.dll</code> in memory, specifically targeting the native <code>Zw*</code> or <code>Nt*</code> functions. By sorting these functions based on their memory addresses, the tool can infer the correct sequential syscall number, an approach similar to techniques used by threat actors like Halo's Gate. This dynamic technique ensures the loader maintains integrity and avoids detection based on incorrect or hardcoded syscall numbers.</p>

    <h2>üì¶ Evasion Technique 2: Custom Reflective DLL Loading</h2>

    <h3>In-Memory Execution and Artifact Avoidance</h3>
    <p>Reflective DLL loading is defined as loading a DLL directly from memory rather than relying on the Windows operating system loader to load it from the file system. The payload, typically a malicious DLL implant, is stored in an encrypted state within the Nighthawk loader binary. Upon execution, it is decrypted and injected directly into the memory space of a legitimate target process (T1055.002) without generating any corresponding file artifact on disk (T1070.004).</p>
    <p>The Nighthawk tool incorporates custom logic to manually execute the functions normally handled by the Windows OS loader. This custom loader logic performs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mapping the DLL image into a newly allocated executable memory region using the stealthy <code>ZwAllocateVirtualMemory</code> syscall.</li>
        <li>Performing necessary base relocation.</li>
        <li>Manually resolving all imported functions (Import Address Table - IAT), completely circumventing the standard <code>LoadLibrary</code> call.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because the payload never resides on the file system, static analysis and file-based detection mechanisms are rendered ineffective.</p>
